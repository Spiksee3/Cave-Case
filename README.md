Hi! Here youll find the files for printing the Cave case, for extensions head to Arcturus.

This case is for the following components : 
- 903052 Battery (or smaller)
- BMI160
- Wemos D1 Mini 3.0 (micro b version)
- tp4056 type C
- 26AWG wire (or smaller. Nothing bigger.)
- Aliexpress Power Switch (DPDT 2P2T)
- 2in elastic straps (Main case) or 1.5, it works too.
- 1in elastic straps (extensions)

**Recommended Print settings:**
- 15% infill
- supports only necessary on the body switch hole, everything else is fine
- .32mm print quality

  
**For labeled lids**:
Cave Case is still in the early stages so labeled lids will be added slowly
Currently available:
- Hip
- LT, RT = Left Thigh, Right Thigh
- LAnk, RAnk = Left Ankle, Right Ankle

**Possible FAQ**
- The switch hole snaps a bit when i force it in
 it works better bcus you have more friction holding it in, also i have spent enough time so idrc.

- Will you add more labelled cases?
 yeah nah, unless you want me to make some more then just add it as an issue on github.

- It doesn't fit the pieces i have/ fix it
 i am finally free, go check arcturus or make a fork of this and do it yourself.

**Tips for customising the case for your parts**
- leave an extra 2 millimetres on width and one extra on height for ports and switches (Trust).
- eyeball a gap for boards or batteries
- if you don't have calipers for measuring you can do this instead:
1. go into blender and make a cube, export it into cura and then use the sizing controls along with a millimetre ruler to make the shape of your component
2. When done export out of cura by doing File>Export> and then set it as a wavefront .obj file
3. put that into your 3d modelling software of choice, if you're using blender search up boolean tutorials online
4. Good luck, this process is going to SUCK, it took me 3+ days as of writing this and my imus haven't arrived and i'm hoping that i dont have to reprint anything bcus i've already wasted a third of a roll of filament.
