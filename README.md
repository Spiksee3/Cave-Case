Hi! Here youll find the files for printing the Cave case, for extensions head to Arcturus.

This case is for the following components : 
- 903052 Battery (or smaller)
- BMI160
- Wemos D1 Mini 3.0 (micro b version)
- tp4056 type C
- 26AWG wire (or smaller. Nothing bigger.)
- Aliexpress Power Switch (DPDT 2P2T)
- 2in elastic straps (Main case) or 1.5, it works too.
- 1in elastic straps (extensions)

**Recommended Print settings:**
- 15% infill
- supports only necessary on the body switch hole, everything else is fine
- .32mm print quality

  
**For labeled lids**:
Cave Case is still in the early stages so labeled lids will be added slowly
Currently available:
- Hip
- LT, RT = Left Thigh, Right Thigh
- LAnk, RAnk = Left Ankle, Right Ankle

**Possible FAQ**
- The switch hole snaps a bit when i force it in
 it works better bcus you have more friction holding it in, also i have spent enough time so idrc.

- Will you add more labelled cases?
 yeah nah, unless you want me to make some more then just add it as an issue on github.

- It doesn't fit the pieces i have/ fix it
 i am finally free, go check arcturus or make a fork of this and do it yourself. also if you're going to do that leave an extra 2 millimetres on width and one extra on height (Trust).
